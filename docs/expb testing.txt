As you have to do it from a 48K or 128K personality with no ESXDOS configured you just have to type in the four OUT statements: 
OUT 9275,135: OUT 9531,246
OUT 9275,128: OUT 9531,64
soft reset
Then you should see ESXDOS load.

Ff you have a Kempston Port on it that you want to use then you can create a small BASIC program on ESXDOS itself to do this 10 OUT 9275,134:OUT 9531,191:OUT 9275,136:OUT 9531,253
That will disable onboard and enable the one on the interface.  If the onboard ones are set at boot to be Sinclair 1 and 2 you have three joysticks!

OUT 9275,2: OUT 9531,128
OUT 9275,2: OUT 9531,0

if you have the divmmc attached, you should probably disable the divmmc per usual and boot as a 48k
internal divmmc nmi will be disabled if the internal divmmc is disabled
