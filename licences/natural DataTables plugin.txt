/**
 * Data can often be a complicated mix of numbers and letters (file names
 * are a common example) and sorting them in a natural manner is quite a
 * difficult problem.
 * 
 * Fortunately a deal of work has already been done in this area by other
 * authors - the following plug-in uses the [naturalSort() function by Jim
 * Palmer](http://www.overset.com/2008/09/01/javascript-natural-sort-algorithm-with-unicode-support) to provide natural sorting in DataTables.
 *
 *  @name Natural sorting
 *  @summary Sort data with a mix of numbers and letters _naturally_.

 *
 *  @example
 *    $('#example').dataTable( {
 *       columnDefs: [
 *         { type: 'natural', targets: 0 }
 *       ]
 *    } );
 *
 *    Html can be stripped from sorting by using 'natural-nohtml' such as
 *
 *    $('#example').dataTable( {
 *       columnDefs: [
 *    	   { type: 'natural-nohtml', targets: 0 }
 *       ]
 *    } );
