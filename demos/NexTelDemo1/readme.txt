About NexTel
------------

NexTel is a ViewData/VideoTex client for the ZX Spectrum Next.

https://www.specnext.com/about/

It will use the Next's ESP-01 wifi module to connect to Prestel-like servers on the internet, such as the TELSTAR server where some of the pages in this demo originate.

Support for telesoftware and regional character sets is planned.

The first demo is a rolling set of static pages, showing off its distinctively retro and nostalgic graphical capabilities. But because this is the ZX Spectrum Next there is no attribute clash!

Some frames had minor edits to make them fit in 24 rows. NexTel will soon have a 25th row, implemented using sprites.
