v1.97D (2018-03-03)
===================
* Fixed Browser to respond to shifted cursor right key (as well as 8); exposed
  by recent keymap changes.
* Fix for missing cursor in INPUT and Browser inputs etc (broken in v1.97C).
* Ensure snapshots are always loaded in layer 0.
* Ensure standard .SCR screenshots are loaded from the Browser in layer 0.

v1.97C (2018-02-28)
===================
* Fixed bug in window printing routines, where double-width/height printing
  routine overwrote calculator memories causing incorrect output of floating-
  point numbers.

v1.97B (2018-02-22)
===================
* Improved boot speed (typically ~3x faster from ROM load to menu display;
  this went from 3.6s to 1.2s on 16GB Toshiba FlashAir with 3 partitions).
* When tape loading occurs, border is set to red immediately so this is more
  obvious to the user.
* Fixed problems with automatic creation of .BAK files when overwriting existing
  files.
* Fixed swapping of Editor/BASIC modes and speeds etc if an error occured during
  evaluation of a standalone expression in BASIC or the Calculator.
* Prevented scroll pause occuring when using "Screen" option in 64/85 col mode.
* Fixed renaming problems in the Browser, where only the short filename was
  provided to edit for the last file in the list.
* Fixed moving of directories to ensure the ".." special entry is correctly
  updated to point to the new parent directory.
* Fixed editor so that following execution of a BASIC statement/program, the
  same lines are displayed as before (instead of returning to program top).
* Fixed cursors becoming hidden or orphaned when switching between 32/64/85
  columns in the Calculator.
* Fixed syntax-checking of PWD #n and CAT #n commands (broken by v1.97 changes).
* Fixed parsing of CAT command; now CAT- #n commands are correctly parsed.

v1.97A (2018-02-19)
===================
* Enabled use of Z80N PixelDn instruction in text output code for windows &
  layer 1/2 screens (requires core v1.10.17+).
* Fixed permanent INVERSE/OVER settings for layer 1/2 modes - these were being
  ignored.

v1.97 (2018-02-19)
==================
* Updated PLAY command to support turbosound. 9 strings may now be specified,
  with each set of 3 going to a different AY chip.
* Added L,R,S parameters to PLAY command: these confine the audio output for
  the current AY chip to either the Left or Right channels (or S to reinstate
  stereo).
* Reduced default volume to 13 when more than 3 PLAY strings are specified, to
  prevent clipping.
* Implemented DRAW, CIRCLE and POINT commands for all layer 1/2 modes. CIRCLE
  for layer 1/2 is implemented using Bresenham's algorithm for improved speed.
* Allow PLOT, DRAW and CIRCLE to include off-screen points on layer 1/2 modes,
  so clipped shapes may easily be drawn without invoking out-of-screen errors.
* Implemented support for temporary colour items for PLOT/DRAW/CIRCLE on layer 1/2.
* Fixed temporary colour item support in layer 1/2 PRINT/INPUT statements.
* Fixed corruption of UDGs S,T,U at NEW/reset.
* Fixed editor to display UDGs within strings correctly, instead of replacing
  them with new NextBASIC tokens.
* Started using more Z80N instructions where possible for speed & space-saving,
  particularly: NextReg, PixelAd, PixelDn, SetAe, PushVal.
  NOTE: This change means v1.97+ requires core 1.10.14+ to run stably.

v1.96A (2018-02-12)
===================
* Fixed TAP loader (TAPLOAD.BAS) to use the new "NEXT #n TO var" syntax.
* Fixed ON ERROR to replace existing error handler at current level, rather
  than installing an additional one.

v1.96 (2018-02-11)
==================
* Implemented procedures, with new DEFPROC, PROC, ENDPROC and LOCAL commands.
* Implemented error-trapping, with new ON ERROR, ERROR and ERROR TO commands.
* For consistency with PROC/DRIVER/ERROR commands, changed syntax of these
  commands:
    DIM #n,var                  -->     DIM #n TO var
    RETURN #n,var               -->     RETURN #n TO var
    NEXT #n,var                 -->     NEXT #n TO var
    BANK n PEEK offset,var      -->     BANK n PEEK offset TO var
  (This will also apply to the as-yet-unimplemented POINT command).
* Removed "Boot A:" menu option: unneeded as Browser will be made to auto-boot
  any disk images that it mounts.
* Remove NEW DATA/NEW EXP commands: these will later be replaced by .mkdata
  and .mkswap dot commands.
* Stubbed out FORMAT d$ command: this will later be done by .mkdsk and/or
  .format dot commands.
* Some refactoring to save space in the NextBASIC ROM.
* NOTE: Due to new commands being added, some token values have changed and
        saved NextBASIC programs may need to be re-edited to fix them.

v1.95B (2018-02-06)
===================
* Fixed assignments to elements of integer arrays.
* Corrected "Too many brackets" error to "Too many parentheses"
* Renamed modulus operator from % to MOD to avoid confusion with symbol
  introducing an integer expression.
* Removed unary + and - operators from integer expression evaluator, as all
  values are unsigned in range 0..65535.
* Removed negative STEP processing in integer loops.

v1.95A (2018-02-03)
===================
* Tape SAVEs no longer print "Start tape and press any key" message, so screens
  can be saved without being partly overwritten.
* INPUT now returns zero for an empty numeric input instead of causing a
  "nonsense in BASIC" error.
* After a "LIST n" command, the editor now uses "n" as the current line number
  being edited (as in 48K mode).
* Unsupported keys in menus now produce error beep instead of "success" click.
* Fix for various editing issues in NextOS command-line mode, leading to odd
  cursor movements and other problems.
* Fix for hang in editor after loading BASIC programs from the Browser with
  different line numbers to the previous program.
* Fix for various cursor issues in the Calculator, especially in hi-res modes.
* Fix for screen problems when switching column modes in the Calculator.
* Fix for crash when LAYER 1,3 is executed in NextOS command-line mode.
* Fix for extended mode cursor colour/shape not being updated when an
  unsupported key is pressed.

  the mode in an indeterminate state, causing strange effects after a CLEAR
  or RUN in a non-standard mode.

v1.95 (2018-01-28)
==================
* Implemented LOAD/SAVE/VERIFY...BANK and LOAD/SAVE/VERIFY...LAYER commands,
  so banks and screens in any mode can now be loaded/saved to disk or tape

  of applications with minimal OS involvement (DISK_FILEMAP,DISK_STRMSTART,
  DISK_STRMEND hooks in esxDOS-compatible API)
* Major rework of esxDOS-compatible API layer, including various fixes
* Implemented the following esxDOS hooks:
    F_TELLDIR, F_SEEKDIR, F_REWINDDIR
    M_GETDATE, M_DOSVERSION, M_GETSETDRV
    F_UNLINK, F_CHMOD, F_STAT, F_RENAME

    F_READDIR: returning long filenames (LFNs) if requested
    M_TAPEIN: allowing tape simulation mode to be selected
* Added new M_P3DOS hook, allowing programs and dot commands to easily
  access +3DOS/IDEDOS/NextOS API calls, using the RST $8 mechanism

v1.93C (2018-01-05)
===================
* Fixed default ULA colours; previous "normal" colours were too dark.

  which fail to set write mode when opening newly-created files.

v1.93A (2017-12-29)
===================

  and Nirvana multicolour engines detect NextOS as a 128K Spectrum and use
  appropriate timing. (Patch not currently present in GW version of ROMs).
* Fixed v3 Z80 snapshot loading issue where port 1ffd value was not set if
  provided by the snapshot (and was incorrectly set to zero if not provided).

   + Fixed path display line to be cleared before updating (broken by v1.92)
   + Added "copying..." information message during copy operations

v1.92 (2017-12-12)
==================
* Implemented support for real-time clock, requiring valid RTC.SYS in the
  C:/NEXTOS directory, and a ZX Next with RTC module. This support provides:
   + date/timestamps when SD card files/dirs are created or updated

  colour schemes set using the SPECTRUM INK/PAPER/BRIGHT/FLASH/ATTR commands.
* Various fixes for user-defined colour schemes.
* Changed the scroll pause feature for windows to use an inverted block in the
  bottom right-hand corner instead of a flashing one, and to accept any key.
* Fixed crash in scroll pause feature if ENTER/CAPS/EXTEND/GRAPHICS pressed.
* Fix loading of 48K SNA snapshots where SP lies between $4000 and $4005. Not
  normally seen, but can be created by SNASM.

  loading some games (eg TransAm).

v1.91 (2017-12-05)
==================
* Fix for TILE commands hanging in invalid modes.
* Rainbow stripes in banners now look consistent with original 128K machines.
* Fixed loading of 128K SNA snapshots where page 7 was the "current" page (not
  properly fixed in v1.86).
* Added workaround to support some 128K TAPs (eg Thanatos 128K) which load the
  stack including returns into the original 128K syntax ROM.
* Fix for error reporting in PLOT command, which previously caused hangs.
* Re-enabled PLAY command (now loaded at boot from new overlay.sys file).

  by trapping original 128K command class returns in ROM 2 and diverting to ROM 1.
* Fix for NextBASIC banner being left on-screen during direct command execution.
* Fix for crash if dot command executed after a previous dot command had
  abnormally terminated (eg BREAK in screen output)

v1.89 (2017-11-30)
==================
* Added remount/mkdir/rename/copy/paste/erase options to Browser
* Added fine-grain control of new Browser features in IDE_BROWSER API call

      channels may have disappeared
    + ensure required peripheral settings (Timex modes on, DivMMC auto-paging off,
      turbo selection on, AYs on, multiface currently disabled)
* Fixed Browser to set the currently-selected drive for LOAD and SAVE operations
  as well as general disk operations
* Implemented lower-screen editing for Hi-res, so "screen" editing mode is now
  usable in 64/85 column modes
* The NextOS command line menu option now has a persistent mode, so BASIC always
  inherits the currently-selected editing mode (unlike the NextBASIC option,
  which still has distinct display modes for editing and BASIC)
* Extended mode symbols underneath keys Y,U,P,A,S,D,F,G now available with just
  symbol shift+key (copyright symbol is symbol shift+Q since P already has ").

  esxemu.sys now all stamped with current NextOS version number and validated
  at boot time.
* Fixed potential memory/stack corruption and hangs when switching between
  LAYER 0 and LAYER 1/2.
* Prevented keypress at BASIC report from being passed to the menu system
  (typically the user would press ENTER and the first menu item, ie Browser,
  would be automatically executed).

v1.86 (2017-11-14)
==================
* Complete re-write of windowing code:
    + Implemented all features in all modes, with the exception of line input
    + Optimised window character output routine in standard and Timex modes

  sprite layer (NB: sprite clip not yet working/available in hardware)

v1.84 (2017-10-25)
==================
* ROMs renamed (nxten2eE.rom -> enNextOS.rom, and p3divmmc.rom -> nextmmc.rom)
  NOTE: Don't forget to update your config.ini to reflect this
* esxDOS emulation layer is now loaded from a file, C:/NEXTOS/ESXEMU.BIN
* Implemented full error reporting for dot commands
* Fixed some issues with parts of dot command names and parameters sometimes
  being tokenized (eg /bin would be tokenized with BIN keyword)
* Fixed bug where dot command couldn't be entered as first statement on a
  program line (due to calculator accepting it as an expression)
* Fixed tokenisation problems preventing > and < being accepted in expressions
* Dot commands can now formally be executed from anywhere by starting name
  with . or / path character, eg to execute "mycommand" in current directory:
