TRASHMAN
""""""""

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS:
LOAD by typing LOAD "TRASHMAN"

PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS:
Play is available for either 1 or 2 players. Use cursor keys for
movement of Trashman. Alternatively 'Trashman' is
compatible with the Kempston or cursor key type joystick
(i.e. Protek), and the Sinclair Interface II.

NAME:
To enter your name, press up or down key until required
letter is reached, and then the O key (fire button). Up to
eight letters may be entered. Move to end of bracket and
press fire button for next screen. If more than one player,
enter YES by using up or down key and fire button and then
proceed as above.

OBJECT:
The object of the game is to empty all the bins from each
road into the dustcart which is slowly moving up the road,
before your bonus points reduce to zero. If you step on the
grass the bonus score will reduce rapidly, but you can
increase it by completing tasks you are asked to do by
householders. (Leave the house by holding the down key).
Your score is increased for each bin emptied. Some houses
will have dogs in them, which will chase you if you step on
the grass, and if they bite you, your injury will result in a 
limp, which will slow you down. The same effect will occur if
you are knocked down by a bike.

If you choose to go into the cafe or pup to collect valuable
bonus points, beware of overeating or drinking too much.

If your bonus score is reduced to zero you will be allowed two
more attempts to improve. Should you mis-judge crossing
the road and are hit by a car the game will end.
